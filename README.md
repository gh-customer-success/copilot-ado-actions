Testing Copilots ability to convert an ADO pipeline to Actions Syntax 

This was Copilots response to the prompt `convert the selected azure devops pipeline to github workflow actions`

> Converting an Azure DevOps pipeline to GitHub Actions requires a bit of work as the syntax and structure of the two systems are different. However, I can provide you with a general plan to follow:
>
> Create a new GitHub repository and clone it to your local machine.
> Create a new directory in the root of the repository called .github/workflows.
> Create a new YAML file in the .github/workflows directory with a name that describes the workflow, such as build-and-deploy.yml.
> Copy the contents of the ado.yml file you provided into the new YAML file.
> Modify the syntax of the YAML file to conform to the GitHub Actions syntax. This will involve changing the names of some of the steps and tasks, as well as modifying the inputs and outputs of some of the steps.
> Replace any Azure DevOps-specific tasks with equivalent GitHub Actions tasks. For example, you can use the actions/checkout action to check out the repository, and the Azure/login action to authenticate with Azure.
> Test the workflow by pushing the changes to the repository and observing the workflow run in the Actions tab of the repository.
